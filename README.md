# Sudoku-Solver
A Sudoku Solver written in c++

This program takes a unfinished soduku puzzle as input and solves it using a recursive algorithm.

If were to go back and inprove this project I would change the input method.
Currently, for input, the program uses classes from my previous projects that are more complicated than they to be.
I would defidently change the input method to make it simpler and smaller.
