phuto code for sudoku solver:
By Dale Westberg (Bleu)

vars:

board[9][9]
    9 x 9 array of int
    represents the boardstate
    1 to 9
    0 if space is blank



functions:

funct printer
    prints out the 9x9 board to a file or the screen


funct possible
    params: (all int)
        x: x-cordinate 1-9
        y: y-cordinate 1-9
        n: value 1-9 to check the legality of

    returns:
        bool value
            True: n is a possible value
            False: n is not a possible value

    instructions:
        loop through each int in row x and check if they are equal to n
            if they are equal return False
        loop through each int in colum y and check if they are equal to not
            if they are equal return False
        check each int in the square the x,y int is located
            if any are equal return False
        if non of the above conditions are met, return true


funct solver
    instructions:
    loop x from 1 to 9 inclusively
        loop y from 1 to 9 inclusively
            if board[x][y] = 0 then
                loop i from 1 to 9
                    if possible(x,y,i) returns true
                        set board[x][y] = i
                        call solver() recursively
                        if solver returns then backtrack by setting board[x][y] = 0
                if you loop through all then return
    if you loop though all possiblies then the puzzles is solved
    call printer() to print the board
    ask the user if they want to keep going
